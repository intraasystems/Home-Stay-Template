<p>Dargah Sharief, the Holy Tomb,  of Yemmemadu is one of the most sacred shrines for Muslims in Kodagu district. It is the 'Dargah' or the tomb of Hazrath Sufi Shaeed and Sayyed Hassan Sakaf Halramir who came from Persia and devoted their life to the service and upliftment of the poor and downtrodden. Sufi Shaeed came to Yemmemadu around 366 years ago to give religious discourses and to help the poor. He soon attracted people of all faiths due to his views and practices. People belonging to various faiths visited the place ever since.</P>
<P>Every year 'Urus' or 'Urs'  is held here for eight days in their remembrance where devotees gather in large numbers. About three to four lakh devotees cutting across caste, creed, and religion visit this sacred shrine. The number of people visiting Yemmemadu Darga Sharief, mostly from Karnataka and kerala State, has increased of late. On the last day of the 'Urs' food is served to all the visitors.
Females are denied entry into the 'Darga' or the tomb for historic reasons. Separate arrangements has been made to enable them to offer prayers.
The Yemmemadu Tajul Islam Muslim Jamaat and the management committee of the Sahidiya Orphanage supervised the Urus and the Darga. The orphanage was constructed in 1997 through public donations.</p>
<P><B>Note:</B> Muslims do not worship 'Dargah' or the Holy Tomb of Saint/s rather they worship God Almighty through the holy man laid in the tomb; For their blessings are considered most healing as saints or 'Sufis' (Soofi) are considered to be very close to God with their persona, devotion, purity and worships. Sufism  is a mystical dimension of Islam.</P>
